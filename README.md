- 👋 Hi, I’m @GusMeir. I am new to coding, and I am learning Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in feet and skateboards
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to plot straight lines on a graph in Python, so I can show my math teacher, and so I can stop using GeoGebra.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with anyone. I'd love to learn anything really. 
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord:
